= Mapping

When dealing with content from/to Marklogic a `MarklogicConverter` come into play to perform conversion operation from the Marklogic Content API to the domain Entity class to use.
A default `MarklogicMappingConverter` is provided to implement this read/write operations. Those operations will mostly be delegated to the ConversionService (expect for reading native content).

[[mapping-conversion]]
== Data mapping and type conversion

A default `MarklogicConverters` is called to register some XML and Marklogic oriented conversion.

When retrieve content from Marklogic :

- Native type are returned as it
- Object annotated @XmlRootElement are mapped from the given xml following Jaxb rules

When dealing with invocation parameters. Variable are converted to XdmValue following the given rules for native values

[cols="3,1,6", options="header"]
.Type
|===
| Type
| Type conversion
| Sample

| `null`
| `XSString`
| `''`

| `String`
| `XSString`
| `'param'`

| `Boolean`
| `XSBoolean`
| `fn:true()`

| `Integer`
| `XSInteger`
| `42`

| `Long`
| `XSLong`
| `4242`
|===

For other objects, the default converter wil be able to convert @XmlRootElement annotated object to XSString using JaxbMarshalling.

For instance the following person

[source,java]
----
new Person("stephane", 37);
----

Will be transform as a String in its xml format

[source,xml]
----
<person>
    <id>42</id>
    <name>stephane</name>
    <age>37</age>
</person>
----

Finally, collection of entities are wrap in there xml representation

[source,java]
----
    Arrays.asList(new Person("stephane", 37), new Person("sahbi", 27))
----

[source,xml]
----
<wrapper>
    <person>
        <id>42</id>
        <name>stephane</name>
        <age>37</age>
    </person>
    <person>
        <id>12</id>
        <name>sahbi</name>
        <age>27</age>
    </person>
</wrapper>
----

NOTE: The variable are really String repr√©sentation of the XML. To use XPath on such variables you primarily need to unquote them. See https://docs.marklogic.com/xdmp:unquote[xdmp:unquote^].
This is because XCC client don't natively support XML Node variables nor sequences.

[[mapping-usage-events]]
=== Mapping Framework Events

Events are fired throughout the lifecycle of the mapping process. This is described in the <<marklogic.mapping-usage.events,Lifecycle Events>> section.

Simply declaring these beans in your Spring ApplicationContext will cause them to be invoked whenever the event is dispatched.

[[mapping-explicit-converters]]
=== Overriding Mapping with explicit Converters

When storing and querying your objects it is convenient to have a `MarklogicConverter` instance handle the mapping of all contents. However, sometimes you may want the `MarklogicConverter`s do most of the work but allow you to selectively handle the conversion for a particular type or to optimize performance.

To selectively handle the conversion yourself, register one or more one or more `org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter` instances with the MarklogicConverter.

NOTE: Spring 3.0 introduced a core.convert package that provides a general type conversion system. This is described in detail in the Spring reference documentation section entitled http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html#core-convert[Spring Type Conversion].
